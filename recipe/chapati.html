    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Adopted from Indian cuisine, African bread known as chapati has been a
        part of East African cuisine for centuries. The East African recipe is
        slightly different from its Indian counterpart. This bread accompanies
        African soups and stews well. Preparation is minimal, making this a
        great choice for cooks in a pinch.

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix together 2 cups flour and salt in a large bowl until well
            combined. Slowly mix in enough warm water to make a thick dough. Mix
            in oil until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer dough to a cool surface and knead for a few minutes, adding
            2 teaspoonfuls flour. Return dough to the same bowl, cover with a
            clean cloth, and let rest for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide dough into orange-sized balls. Flatten into 6-inch circles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry in batches in the hot skillet, turning once, until golden brown
            and spotted, 6 to 8 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough. Keep
            chapatis warm in the oven.
