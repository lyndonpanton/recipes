            Vegetable Oil: 2 tbsp
        </li>
        <li>
            Lime (juiced): 1/2
        </li>
        <li>
            Fajita Seasoning: 2 tbsp
        </li>
        <li>
            Refried Beans (warm): 1 cup
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheddar Cheese (shredded): 2/3 cups
        </li>
        <li>
            Mexican Rice (cooked): 1 1/2 cups
        </li>
        <li>
            Sour Cream: 1/4 cup
        </li>
        <li>
            Guacamole: 1/3 cup
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken, onion, bell pepper, oil, lime juice, and fajita
            seasoning in a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and squeeze to
            ensure all ingredients are combined and well-coated; place in the
            refrigerator to marinate for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan
            with foil. Spread fajita mixture onto sheet pan in a single layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until chicken juices run clear, about 25
            minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken
            strips should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap tortillas in a damp paper towel, and warm in the microwave
            until soft and pliable, about 30 seconds. To assemble burritos,
            spread 1/4 of each of the refried beans, cheese, rice, fajita
            mixture, sour cream, and guacamole in a line across the middle of
            each tortilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold opposing sides of the tortilla in, overlapping the filling.
            Roll the bottom edge up tightly around the filling, then roll the
            burrito away from you, keeping the sides folded in.
        </li>
    </ol>
